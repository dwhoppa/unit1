## Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition

My client Mr N, is the owner the owner of a web design company. –ês the company is small the employees did not think about keeping all the passwords of their deisgn software that they use in one place under protection. At the moment they store all passwords in a shared document in Google Docs, which has only one level of protection, it implies that there is a very high risk that anyone can gain access to the document and steal all the data. The owner predicts that the company will expand in the very near future, so they want to be prepared in advance and keep all the passwords safe.

## Proposed solution

After I spoke with my client, we came up with a solution to this problem. Create a calculator program that will perform basic functions such as (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Also the calculator can give feedback on basic errors (e.g. division by 0). However, if user enters a secret password (for example: 1234), the program will turn into a password manager. It will be able to perform such functions as: Create, Replace, Update, Delete passwords.  This program will keep all passwords safe. 

## Success criteria

The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
Add a password (for example, for a website).
View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
Save passwords permanently and securely
Use the terminal to interact with the user.
