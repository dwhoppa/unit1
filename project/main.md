My client Mr N, is the owner the owner of a web design company. –ês the company is small the employees did not think about keeping all the passwords in one place under protection. At the moment they store all passwords in a shared document in Google Docs, which has only one level of protection, it implies that there is a very high risk that anyone can gain access to the document and steal all the data. The owner predicts that the company will expand in the very near future, so they want to be prepared in advance and keep all the passwords safe.
